# A Right-to-left Hamburger Menu

To my knowledge, there has not been a decent right-to-left hamburger menu out there. So, I decided to create one by my own. The following code is created by only HTML and CSS and there is no Javascript code included. 

I have also made it responsive so that it takes 20%, 30% and 50% of the screen in widescreen, normal, and smartphone displays, respectively. You can see a demo of it [in this link](https://habibseifzadeh.github.io).

In addition, I have aimed to use variables for colors, speeds, ... so that anyone can easily customize it based on their needs.

Enjoy using it and feel free to contact me should you have any further inquiries.
